# Facial Expression Removal from 3D Images for recognition purposes
We present an encoder-decoder neural network to remove deformations caused by expressions from 3D face images. It receives a 3D face with or without expressions as input and outputs its neutral form. Our objective is not to obtain the most realistic results but to enhance the accuracy of 3D face recognition systems.
